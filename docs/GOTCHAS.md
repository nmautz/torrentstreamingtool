# Gotchas

Non-obvious behaviours and footguns. Read before changing anything load-bearing.

## VLC

### Track IDs are ES IDs, not 1/2/3 counters

VLC's `audio_track` / `subtitle_track` commands accept **elementary stream IDs** — the number N in each `"Stream N"` key of `vs.information.category`. Using sequential per-type counters (1, 2, 3 for audio; 1, 2, 3 for subs) sends the wrong ID and the command silently does nothing. The `<audiotrack>`/`<subtitletrack>` values in the XML status are also ES IDs, so the "current" highlight in the UI dropdown only works if they're compared as ES IDs.

See `get_tracks()` ([main.py:2799](../main.py#L2799)) — `es_id = int(key.split()[-1])`.

### VLC 3.x has no current-track in status

`status.xml` / `status.json` don't include `<audiotrack>` or `<subtitletrack>` in VLC 3.x. We track it ourselves in `state.current_audio_track` / `state.current_subtitle_track`, reset to `-1` on every new `in_play`. The `POST /api/vlc/track/*` endpoints update this state.

### Absolute vs relative seek

- Absolute: `val=N%` (percentage) or `val=Ns` (seconds). Our `/api/vlc/seek/to` uses `val=N%`
- Relative: `val=+Ns` / `val=-Ns`. Our `/api/vlc/seek?delta=N` uses this

`val=N` with no suffix is interpreted as a **0–1 fraction**, not seconds. Don't confuse them.

### File path → URI

Always use `Path(p).resolve().as_uri()` when sending to VLC. This:
- Handles symlinks (important — VLC plays the resolved path, so `library_current_file` is also stored resolved)
- Generates correct `file:///C:/...` on Windows and `file:///...` on macOS/Linux without extra string surgery

### Volume scale mismatch

VLC uses 0–512 (256 = 100 %). Our API uses 0–200 (100 = normal). Conversion is `raw = volume / 100 * 256`. The global `settings.max_volume` cap is also 0–200. `state.vlc_volume` is in our scale.

`vlc("in_play", ...)` pushes a `volume` command first so VLC's default doesn't blast briefly. Important when the global cap is low.

### Volume cap must be re-applied at every track start

`state.vlc_volume` is polled directly from VLC every 2 s, so it tracks VLC's reality — which can drift above the user's `max_volume` cap (e.g., VLC defaults to 100 on a fresh start, and `user_volume_before_bg` is seeded to 100 before the user ever touches the slider). Two defenses, both required:

1. `vlc("in_play")` clamps `state.vlc_volume` by the current cap **before** sending the pre-play `volume` command. Otherwise a low cap (say 60) plus a 100-default `user_volume_before_bg` blasts at 100 on every bg→content handoff.
2. The state broadcaster ([main.py:1112](../main.py#L1112)) checks the polled VLC volume against the cap each tick and pushes a correction if VLC is over. This self-heals against VLC's occasional snap-to-100 on playlist advance.

Don't drop either one thinking the other covers it — #1 is fast (no audible blast), #2 is the safety net for mid-playback drift.

### Restart-on-retry

`POST /api/retry` ([main.py:2610](../main.py#L2610)) calls `_restart_vlc_process()` which kills all `vlc`/`VLC` processes, sleeps 1.5 s, relaunches with `--extraintf=http`, waits for the port. Then replays the current file + remainder of playlist. Used when VLC freezes on a partially-downloaded file.

### Windows window control needs ctypes

`_find_vlc_hwnds_windows` uses `EnumWindows` via ctypes; the EnumWindowsProc wrapper must be kept alive (`cb = EnumWindowsProc(_cb)` and pass `cb`, not `_cb` directly) or ctypes will GC it and the callback will crash.

### Focus-stealing prevention → flashing taskbar → visible taskbar

When VLC is relaunched in the background (DETACHED_PROCESS, e.g. after `/api/retry`), a plain `SetForegroundWindow` is usually blocked by Windows' focus-stealing prevention. The fallback is a **taskbar attention flash** on VLC's icon — and a flashing icon also forces the taskbar to stay visible **even over a fullscreen window**, so the user sees both the flashing icon and the taskbar until they click it.

`_vlc_focus_windows` ([main.py:707](../main.py#L707)) defeats this with the full cocktail: zero `SPI_SETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT`, synthesize an ALT keypress (any keystroke releases the foreground lock), AttachThreadInput, `BringWindowToTop` + `SetForegroundWindow`, then `_stop_vlc_flash_windows` (FlashWindowEx with `FLASHW_STOP`) to clear any flash that was already raised. `vlc_focus_and_fullscreen` calls `_stop_vlc_flash_windows` a second time after toggling fullscreen, because Explorer can re-raise the flash when the window changes state. Don't drop either flash-stop call — without them the retry-then-flash bug returns.

## qBittorrent

### `setSequentialDownload` doesn't exist

The qBittorrent API endpoint is `toggleSequentialDownload`. It's a toggle, so check `seq_dl` from `qbit_info` before calling — see `qbit_streaming_mode` ([main.py:344](../main.py#L344)). Sequential is also passed at add-time as the `sequentialDownload=true` form field to `/torrents/add`.

### Don't enable first/last-piece priority

`toggleFirstLastPiecePrio` fetches the last piece early. That **breaks** piece-order streaming because the playhead is at the start, not the end. We deliberately leave it off.

### LocalHost auth is disabled

`setup.py` writes `WebUI\LocalHostAuth=false` to qBit's ini. Localhost requests never need a cookie. `qbit_login` is still called on startup and `qreq` retries on 403 for safety, but the cookie is mostly cosmetic.

### Sequential vs library downloads

Stream-now uses sequential. Library downloads do NOT — they should download normally so all files arrive. See [BACKEND.md](BACKEND.md#pipelines).

## VPN

### Two enforcement points

1. `vpn_guard` in `main.py` ([main.py:997](../main.py#L997)) — kills qBit when VPN drops; gates `/api/stream` and `/api/library/download` via `state.vpn_secure`
2. `watchdog.py` ([watchdog.py:343](../watchdog.py#L343)) — kills qBit if it's running while VPN is down, AND refuses to restart it until VPN reconnects

If you're tempted to remove one, **don't**. They cover different failure modes:
- `vpn_guard` runs inside the dashboard process and protects the API
- `watchdog.py` runs in a thread (or as a separate service) and protects the process

### Mullvad CLI missing → treated as unsafe

Both guards return `vpn=False` if `mullvad` is not in PATH. Cannot-verify = unsafe. Make sure the CLI is on PATH (or set `_MULLVAD_BIN` in `.env`).

## Jackett

### `Category[]=0` returns no results

Jackett treats `0` as an unknown category ID, not "all". To search all categories, omit the `Category[]` parameter entirely. See `/api/search` ([main.py:2272](../main.py#L2272)) — only passes `Category[]` when `INDEXER_CATEGORIES != "0"`.

### Remote Jackett vs local

`INDEXER_URL` hostname is parsed in `run.py` and `watchdog.py`. If it's `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1` → try to launch + monitor locally. Otherwise → reachability check only, never launch. This is the correct behavior — remote Jackett shouldn't be launched from the local machine.

### Windows service vs tray exe

The Jackett Windows installer registers a `Jackett` Windows service that runs as LocalSystem and actually serves port 9117. `JackettTray.exe` is cosmetic — it shows the icon and offers a "Start background service" menu item. Both `setup.py` and `watchdog.py` prefer the service (via `sc.exe start Jackett`) and only fall back to launching the tray exe.

Service config files live under LocalSystem's profile: `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\Jackett` or `C:\ProgramData\Jackett`. **Not** the interactive user's `%APPDATA%`. The `--verbose` mode of `run.py` searches all five candidate locations.

## Library

### `library_item_id` is the "don't auto-delete" flag

`/api/stop` ([main.py:2576](../main.py#L2576)) checks `if state.active_hash and not state.library_item_id` before deleting the torrent. If you're streaming a torrent and then call `/api/stream/save-to-library`, that sets `library_item_id` and the next `/api/stop` will leave files alone.

### `track_pref_applied_file` prevents double-apply

`vlc_progress_tracker` triggers `_apply_track_prefs` when `state.library_current_file != state.track_pref_applied_file`. Without this guard, every 2 s tick would re-send the audio/subtitle commands and the user couldn't override them mid-playback.

### Canonical path matching

VLC plays `Path(p).resolve().as_uri()` (resolved). The stored item file path may not be resolved. `_canonical_item_path` ([main.py:868](../main.py#L868)) compares both as resolved Paths and returns the stored path — so progress and skip-data lookups key correctly against `item.files[].path`.

### Resume hint walks files in order

`find_resume_hint` ([main.py:890](../main.py#L890)):
1. If `last_file` has meaningful in-progress position (>5 s, not completed) → return it
2. Walk `files` in order, return first not-completed file
3. If all completed → return file[0] with `all_completed: true` (UI lets user rewatch from start)

### Frontend drops saveProgress writes under t=5 s

The server recomputes `completed` on every `/api/library/{id}/progress` write as `pct = position/duration > 0.92`. A save at `t≈0` therefore wipes a previously-watched episode back to unwatched. The local player can fire those near-zero writes from at least three places: the very first `timeupdate` event before the resume seek lands, the `pause` event that browsers fire during initial load, and `lpStop` if the user opens the player and closes immediately. `saveProgress` and `_lpFlushProgress` both early-return when `posSec < 5` to keep watched marks stable. The 5 s threshold matches the resume hint's "meaningful in-progress" cutoff, so dropping these writes also has no resume-UX cost.

## SSE

### Per-client queues, dead-queue cleanup

Every `/api/events` connection creates its own `asyncio.Queue(maxsize=100)`. `broadcast` iterates `state.sse_queues`, drops any that raise `QueueFull`. Disconnected clients are cleaned up in the `finally` block of the stream generator.

### EventSource can't set headers

For admin SSE, the token is passed via `?admin_token=…` query param. The middleware accepts it from query string too.

## Offline / Handoff to Device

### Safari iOS will not play MKV from a `<video>` element

Most torrents are MKV with H.264/AAC. Safari iOS's `<video>` element only accepts MP4/M4V/MOV containers with H.264 (or HEVC) + AAC. The offline-prepare endpoint detects this via ffprobe and runs an ffmpeg **remux** (rewrap to MP4 with `-c copy`, ~seconds) when the codecs are already compatible, or a full **transcode** to H.264/AAC (slow, CPU-bound) when they aren't. Don't change the fast-path branches in `_safari_compatible` without confirming the device matrix.

### `/prep-all` must serialize ffmpeg jobs

`/api/library/{id}/prep-all` enumerates every video file in a library item. Without a global concurrency cap, that fires `asyncio.create_task(_run_offline_job(...))` for each file in one tight loop — a 77-episode pack instantly spawns 77 ffmpeg processes. Two failure modes both trip:
1. **NVENC session limit.** Consumer NVIDIA encoders (Pascal/Turing) reject NVENC sessions past the driver's 2–3-encoder cap. Excess jobs ffmpeg-exit immediately with `Cannot load nvcuda.dll`-style errors, the job's `error` field is set, and the UI tallies them as "prep errors".
2. **CPU/IO storm on the libx264 path.** Even with `-threads 2`, 77 concurrent ffmpegs is 150+ encoder threads plus 77 decoders fighting over the same disk, OOM-killing some and timing out others.

Keep the `_offline_job_sem()` semaphore in place (`OFFLINE_JOB_CONCURRENCY = 1`). Jobs sit in `status="pending"` until they acquire it; both `/prep-status` and `/api/offline-active` already treat `pending` as in-progress, so the UI behaves correctly. If you ever raise the cap, also re-baseline `started_at` inside the semaphore (already done) so per-job ETAs don't include queue time.

### IndexedDB blob playback uses `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`

The local player binds the single `<video id="lpVideo">` to a `blob:` URL constructed from the IndexedDB record. Tiny ↔ fullscreen toggling is pure CSS (`.lp-tiny` class on `#localPlayer`); we never move the video element or change `src` mid-playback. Always `URL.revokeObjectURL` on unload (`lpUnloadCurrent`), otherwise iOS will leak memory across episode changes.

`<track src=blob:...>` for VTT subtitles only works because `crossorigin="anonymous"` is set on the `<video>` and the blob URL is same-origin. Don't drop the `crossorigin` attribute.

### Service worker scope must be `/`

`/sw.js` is intentionally served from root (not `/static/sw.js`) so its scope covers the whole app. iOS Safari will silently scope-restrict an SW to its serving directory. Keep the file at the root mount.

### Page-shell offline boot needs a prior successful visit

The SW intercepts `fetch` events only after it's installed for the origin. The user must have loaded `remote.local` at least once with the network reachable; subsequent visits work even when DNS for `remote.local` fails — Safari hits the SW cache for the navigation request.

## Settings

### Two layers of settings

1. **`.env`** (loaded by `pydantic-settings`) — service URLs, credentials, buffer thresholds, admin password
2. **`library.json` → `settings`** — UI-managed library paths, admin overrides (`indexer_categories`)

`/api/search` reads `indexer_categories` from the admin override first, falling back to `.env`. Library paths are unioned across both.

## Python compatibility

`setup.py` and `run.py` are run by **system Python** (any version 3.9+). They use `from __future__ import annotations` so they parse on 3.9. `main.py`, `analyzer.py`, `watchdog.py`, `daemon.py` run inside the venv (also 3.9+ baseline but the project doesn't pin newer syntax).
